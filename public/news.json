This multi-year program is driven by 10 Minute School, a2i, LightCastle Partners, DevLearn and Policy Exchange Bangladesh to change the landscape of female participation in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Despite the different roles of the consortium members, the combined effort is to break gender barriers in STEM related employment in the country. To achieve that goal, Policy Exchange Bangladesh will actively contribute in providing technical assistance and in raising awareness of Bangladesh Public Service Commission (BPSC) by sensitizing and by improving the knowledge in the global best practices, establishing a gender friendly screening tool which will eventually help in fair evaluation. The ultimate goal is to increase awareness and adoption of gender neutral strategies within BPSC, fostering an environment that actively encourages female employment in public institutions. Simultaneously, Policy Exchange Bangladesh will raise awareness and sensitize the officials of the Ministry of Public Administration (MOPA) and then incentivize so that the inclusion of female participation in STEM roles within public institutions become visible."
